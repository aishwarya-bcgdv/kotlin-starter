# Kotlin Starter
Generated from the Spring Initializr, this is a starter project for Kotlin, leveraging some of the best practices I have come across, working at BCG DV.

This project is a simple GET endpoint "/greet" which takes a single "name" parameter and greets this name.

Things included:
- Environment based configuration (dev vs production)
- Ktlint
- Gradle dependency updates/reports
- Code coverage metric gathering
- Statsd integration 
- Example tests (using MockMVC and not RestAssured)
- Embedded Postgres database for running tests
